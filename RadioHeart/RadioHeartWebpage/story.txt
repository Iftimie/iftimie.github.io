It’s emotionally under-specified tech
The story you already told (even if you didn’t realize it)

At its core, your radio heart is about presence without demand.

Phones are aggressive:

buzz

ping

interrupt

escalate anxiety

Your device does the opposite:

no text

no sound

no obligation

no “answer now”

Just:

“Something that matters to you exists nearby.”
Not communication.
Not productivity.
Not safety.

👉 Ambient reassurance.

That’s powerful.

We wanted a way to feel close — without checking a screen.

So we built a small object that doesn’t ask for your attention.

When the other half is near, it breathes light.
When it’s not, it rests.

No messages. No noise. No pressure.

Just a quiet reminder that someone you care about exists in the same space.

1. “I’m thinking of you, without saying it”

long-distance couples

people who hate constant texting

emotionally overloaded people

Light = thought, not message.

disconnected from the internet
limited to ~1km
The honest truth (which is good news)

You are not selling utility.
You are selling permission to feel without interruption.

That’s why:

it doesn’t need to do more

it doesn’t need an app
The core emotional promise (one sentence)

A quiet way to feel close, without talking.

Who this is for (very specific)

Couples who:

live together but are often in different rooms

are long-distance or semi-long-distance

feel overwhelmed by phones, notifications, constant messaging

People who:

don’t want more communication

want less friction and more reassurance

Gifting context:

anniversaries

moving in together

“I know we’re busy lately”

“I’m bad at words but I care”

The refined story (what you’d put on a website / card)

Some connections don’t need words.

Phones interrupt.
Messages demand answers.

We wanted something quieter.

When the other heart is near, it glows.
When it’s not, it rests.

No sound. No screen. No pressure.

Just a small reminder that someone you love exists — right now.
